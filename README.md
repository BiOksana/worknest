### Spring Profiles
This application uses Spring profiles to separate configuration for different environments:

Profile
- dev:	Used for local development and Docker builds. Uses MySQL DB.	-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
- prod	Used for production deployment.                             	-Dspring.profiles.active=prod

### How to run the app:
Running with Docker Compose
Make sure you have Docker installed.
- Build and run the containers:        docker-compose up --build
- Or (if already built):               docker-compose up
Access the application: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

The dev profile will be used automatically via SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev set in docker-compose.yml.

### Mock Data for Testing
Mock data is automatically loaded from the file:  https://github.com/BiOksana/worknest/blob/master/src/main/resources/db/migrations/002_data.sql
